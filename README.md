# Public Deisgn Collective Open Data Repository
*A multi-level, open-source data repository on design practices in Latin America's public sector*

This repository contains the datasets and documentation produced through the Public Design Collective’s multi-phase research on public-sector design and innovation across Latin America. It expands the work introduced in the organization’s main profile and provides **full technical detail**, including data dictionaries, methods, files, and licensing.

## 🧭 Research Context

This repository is part of a broader research effort examining:

- Design integration in public governance  
- Institutional capacity for innovation  
- Regional characteristics of public-sector design  
- Gaps and strengths in the ecosystem  
- Longitudinal patterns of innovation labs  

While the organization profile provides a high-level overview, this repository delivers the **technical backbone** of the project.
