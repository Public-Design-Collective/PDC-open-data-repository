# 📘 Document-Level Dataset  

**Research Phase 1: Literature Review** 

This dataset contains **document-level metadata** extracted from a multilingual literature review on public-sector design and innovation in Latin America. Each row represents a **single publication**, which may reference one or more innovation units, organizations, projects, or individuals.

This dataset forms **Level 0: Publication / Source** of the multi-level taxonomy used across the repository.

## 🧭 Dataset Purpose  
This dataset captures the structure and content of the academic and grey literature addressing:

- Public-sector design practices  
- Government innovation labs  
- Project-level initiatives  
- Practitioners and institutional actors  
- Cross-country comparisons  
- Regional trends in public-sector innovation  

It enables descriptive analysis of the literature base and supports cross-linking to higher levels (Institutional, Organizational, Project, Individual) in subsequent datasets.
